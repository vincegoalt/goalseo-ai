          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>
              I got a call once from a plumber in Belmont Shore. He said, "man, I'm great with pipes but Google don't even know I exist." That stuck with me. Cuz it's real. Most plumbers around Long Beach work hard, 12 hours a day, but online they are invisible.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              That's why seo for plumbers matter. If you ain't on Google, the phone don't ring. And when the phone don't ring, no jobs.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              When people in Long Beach got a clogged sink, they ain't flipping thru Yellow Pages no more. They just pull out a phone and type "plumber near me." If you not in those first results, you might as well not even exist.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 my-8">

              <p>
                I seen it. One plumber in Bixby Knolls barely got any calls. After seo for plumbers, he jumped into the 3-pack map spot. Suddenly, he telling me, "I had to hire my cousin just to keep up." That's what good seo do.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">What is SEO for Plumbers?</h2>

            <p>
              It's simple. It's making Google see your plumbing biz as the best answer when someone search "water heater repair Long Beach" or "emergency plumber near Belmont Heights."
            </p>
            
            <p>
              But it ain't just about stuffing words. Google smart. It knows if you fake it. It looks at reviews, local links, service pages, and even how fast your website load.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think about it like plumbing itself. A pipe system gotta flow. Same for seo. Your website, your Google Business Profile, your reviews, your backlinksâ€”they all gotta connect. If one piece blocked, the whole system leaks.

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>
              Plumbers don't need customers in New York. You need folks in Long Beach, Signal Hill, Lakewood, maybe even down in Seal Beach. That's why local seo for plumbers is different.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-semibold">We build pages that say:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>"Plumber in Belmont Shore"</li>
              <li>"Drain cleaning in Naples Island"</li>
              <li>"Pipe repair near Poly High School"</li>
              <li>"Emergency plumber in Alamitos Beach"</li>
              <li>"Water heater repair near Traffic Circle"</li>
              <li>"Sewer line service in Bixby Knolls"</li>
              <li>"Bathroom plumbing in East Long Beach"</li>
              <li>"Kitchen sink repair near Shoreline Village"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Google loves when you mention real neighborhoods. I even saw better rankings when we talked about Shoreline Village or Traffic Circle area. It shows Google you really local, not some out-of-state company pretending.

                Some plumbers ask, "why not just pay for ads?" Ads work, but they stop the second you stop paying. SEO keep giving long after. As a marketing agency, we don't just do Googleâ€”we help with Facebook ads, Yelp ads, even little postcard mailers if it make sense. But SEO always the base.

                I met a plumber in East Long Beach who said, "I don't even know what to ask for." That's normal. As a marketing consultant, I sit down and show you what works. Maybe you need better photos of your work. Maybe your reviews look fake. Maybe your website missing service pages. I give straight talk, no fancy terms.

                Let's be real, most plumber websites look like they was built in 2003. Tiny text, blurry pictures, no call button. That kills leads. We design clean sites with big phone buttons, fast loading, maps that actually work. Cuz if a customer gotta pinch zoom to find your number, they gone.

              Google ain't dumb. It sees reviews as proof. A plumber in Wrigley had only 3 reviews, all old. After we helped him ask happy customers to leave new ones, he went to 35 reviews. Boomâ€”map rankings shot up.
