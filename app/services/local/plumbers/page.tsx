          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>
              I got a call once from a plumber in Belmont Shore. He said, "man, I'm great with pipes but Google don't even know I exist." That stuck with me. Cuz it's real. Most plumbers around Long Beach work hard, 12 hours a day, but online they are invisible.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              That's why seo for plumbers matter. If you ain't on Google, the phone don't ring. And when the phone don't ring, no jobs.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              When people in Long Beach got a clogged sink, they ain't flipping thru Yellow Pages no more. They just pull out a phone and type "plumber near me." If you not in those first results, you might as well not even exist.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 my-8">

              <p>
                I seen it. One plumber in Bixby Knolls barely got any calls. After seo for plumbers, he jumped into the 3-pack map spot. Suddenly, he telling me, "I had to hire my cousin just to keep up." That's what good seo do.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">What is SEO for Plumbers?</h2>
          
          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>
              It's simple. It's making Google see your plumbing biz as the best answer when someone search "water heater repair Long Beach" or "emergency plumber near Belmont Heights."
            </p>
            
            <p>
              But it ain't just about stuffing words. Google smart. It knows if you fake it. It looks at reviews, local links, service pages, and even how fast your website load.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think about it like plumbing itself. A pipe system gotta flow. Same for seo. Your website, your Google Business Profile, your reviews, your backlinksâ€”they all gotta connect. If one piece blocked, the whole system leaks.

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>
              Plumbers don't need customers in New York. You need folks in Long Beach, Signal Hill, Lakewood, maybe even down in Seal Beach. That's why local seo for plumbers is different.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-semibold">We build pages that say:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>"Plumber in Belmont Shore"</li>
              <li>"Drain cleaning in Naples Island"</li>
              <li>"Pipe repair near Poly High School"</li>
              <li>"Emergency plumber in Alamitos Beach"</li>
              <li>"Water heater repair near Traffic Circle"</li>
              <li>"Sewer line service in Bixby Knolls"</li>
              <li>"Bathroom plumbing in East Long Beach"</li>
              <li>"Kitchen sink repair near Shoreline Village"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Google loves when you mention real neighborhoods. I even saw better rankings when we talked about Shoreline Village or Traffic Circle area. It shows Google you really local, not some out-of-state company pretending.

              I grew up in a family where every house problem, we called the local plumber. I remember my mom yelling when the sink clogged before Thanksgiving dinner. If she had Google back then, she would have searched "emergency plumber Long Beach." That's why I care about seo for plumbers. It ain't just marketingâ€”it's making sure families get help fast.
