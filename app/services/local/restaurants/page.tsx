            <p>
              Friend owns a taco shop on 4th Street. Great food, been there 15 years, but was getting killed by new places. Why? They wasnt on Google Maps. People literally walking past his shop to go somewhere they found online. Crazy right?
            </p>
            
            <p>
              See, nobody uses phonebooks for restaurants no more. They search "Mexican food near me" or "best burger Long Beach" on their phone. If you aint in that map pack showing top 3 results, you invisible. Dont matter how good your food is if nobody knows you exist.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Helped this Vietnamese place in Cambodia Town. They had amazing pho but only locals knew bout it. Got them ranking for "pho near me" and "Vietnamese restaurant Long Beach." Now they got lines out the door on weekends. All from people finding them on Google.
            </p>

              <p>
                Restaurant owner on Pine told me DoorDash taking 30% of every order. Thirty percent! We got him ranking #1 for "pizza delivery Downtown Long Beach" and now 60% of delivery orders come direct through his website. Saved him thousands every month.

            <p>
              Its making sure hungry people find YOUR restaurant first. Not just on Google, but Google Maps, Apple Maps, Yelp, all of it. When someone searching "lunch near me" at noon, you wanna be right there.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Restaurant SEO different though. People search weird for food. "Open now," "cheap eats," "date night," "dog friendly patio." You gotta rank for how people actually search, not just "Italian restaurant."
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think of it like your menu. You dont just say "food" - you describe every dish. Same with SEO. Every cuisine type, every dish, every special thing about your place needs its own strategy.

              This Korean BBQ food truck used to post up at different spots - Bixby Park, CSULB, Downtown. Had great following but wanted brick and mortar. Problem was, nobody knew they opened a restaurant on Atlantic.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We kept all their food truck SEO (people still searching "Korean BBQ truck Long Beach") but added restaurant keywords. Smart move - we made pages for each old truck location pointing to new restaurant. "Missing the Korean BBQ truck at Bixby Park? Find us at our new location!" Boom. Packed from day one.
