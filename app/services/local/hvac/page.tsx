            <p>
              Last summer during that heat wave, I got a call from an AC guy in Alamitos Heights. He said "I'm booked 3 weeks out but my phone ain't ringing for new jobs next month." That's the HVAC problem right there. Feast or famine, and Google controls which one you get.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              See, people dont plan AC repairs. They panic search. "AC repair near me" at 11pm when their unit dies. If you aint on that first page, specially in the map pack, you missing all them emergency calls.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I watched one HVAC company in Signal Hill go from 5 service calls a week to 5 a day. All we did was fix their Google Business Profile and build some pages for "AC repair Signal Hill" and boom. Their dispatcher had to hire help.

            <p>
              But heres the thing about HVAC seo - its seasonal AND emergency. Summer you need AC repair keywords. Winter you need heating keywords. And all year you need them emergency keywords cuz nobody schedules a breakdown.

            <p>
              Think of it like your truck's GPS. If the GPS dont know where you at, you cant get to the job. Same with Google. If Google dont know you fix AC in Belmont Shore, them Belmont Shore people calling someone else.

              My first apartment in Long Beach, the AC died in August. I remember searching Google at 2am, calling the first three companies. Only one answered. They came out, fixed it, charged fair price. 5 years later, still use them for everything.

              That's what good SEO does for HVAC companies. Puts you in front of desperate people who become customers for life. Not just one repair, but maintenance contracts, replacements, referrals. All starts with being findable when they need you most.
