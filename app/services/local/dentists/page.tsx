            <p>
              Dentist friend in Belmont Shore was paying $250 per patient from Facebook ads. Two hundred fifty dollars! For ONE patient! Meanwhile, his competitor down on 2nd Street getting patients free from Google. My buddy almost closed his practice till we fixed his SEO.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              People dont choose dentists from billboards no more. They in pain, searching "emergency dentist near me" at midnight. Or they looking for "pediatric dentist Bixby Knolls" for their kids. If you aint showing up in that map pack, you losing patients every day.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This new dentist opened near Cal State Long Beach. Great modern office, latest equipment, but empty chairs. We got her ranking for "dentist near CSULB" and "student dental discounts." Now she booked solid with college kids. Location dont matter if nobody can find you online.
            </p>

                Dentist in Downtown was struggling. We discovered "Delta Dental dentist Long Beach" getting 300 searches a month. Got him ranking for every insurance provider. Now patients calling specifically cuz he takes their insurance. SEO turned his practice around.

            <p>
              Its making sure when someones tooth killing them or kid needs braces, YOUR dental practice shows up first. Not just Google - Google Maps specially important for dentists cuz people want someone close when they in pain.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Dental SEO different though. You got emergency searches ("tooth pain relief now"), routine searches ("teeth cleaning Long Beach"), and specialized searches ("Invisalign provider"). Each type needs different strategy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think of Google like dental insurance directory but smarter. You showing Google you got the credentials, reviews, location, hours, everything patients looking for. More evidence you provide, higher you rank.

              This dentist near Airport area was closed weekends like most dentists. But we noticed "emergency dentist Saturday Long Beach" getting hundreds of searches. He started opening Saturday mornings just for emergencies.

            <p>
              We optimized everything for weekend emergency searches. Within 3 months, he was seeing 15-20 emergency patients every Saturday at premium rates. Those emergency patients became regular patients. His practice grew 40% just from being findable on weekends. Sometimes opportunity hiding in plain sight.

            <p>
              Biggest missed opportunity for dentists - insurance searches. People literally searching "Cigna dentist Long Beach" or "dentist that takes Medi-Cal." Create page for every insurance you accept. List all plans clearly. These pages convert like crazy cuz people already know you take their insurance.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Also target "no insurance dentist Long Beach" and "dental payment plans." Lots of people without insurance still need dental care. One dentist offers in-house membership plan - gets tons of patients from these searches.
