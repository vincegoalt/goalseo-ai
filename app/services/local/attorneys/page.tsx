            <p>
              Buddy of mine, personal injury lawyer downtown, told me something wild. He was spending $15,000 a month on Google Ads. Fifteen grand! Every month! Then we got him ranking organic for "car accident lawyer Long Beach" and he cut that ad spend in half. Still got same amount of cases.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Thing is, people dont trust ads for lawyers. They scrolling past them sponsored results looking for "real" law firms. When you ranking organic, specially with good reviews, thats when they call. And them calls worth money - one car accident case can be worth $50k+ in fees.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Saw this family law attorney in Belmont Heights struggling bad. Yellow Pages dead, referrals slow, didnt know what to do. We built her SEO around "divorce attorney Long Beach" and "child custody lawyer near me." Six months later she hired two associates. All from Google.
            </p>

                One criminal defense attorney was invisible online. We found "DUI lawyer Long Beach" getting 500 searches a month. Got him to #1. First year he tracked $1.2 million in cases from that ONE keyword. No joke. Right keywords for lawyers literally worth millions.

            <p>
              Its making sure when someone gets arrested at 2am, injured in accident on 405, or served divorce papers, YOUR law firm shows up first. Not the billboard lawyer. Not the TV commercial guy. You.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              But lawyer SEO different than other businesses. Ethics rules, bar regulations, cant say certain things. Plus you competing with massive firms got whole marketing departments. But heres secret - local beats big every time if you do it right.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think of Google like a judge. You presenting evidence that you the best lawyer for the case. Reviews = testimony. Content = expertise. Local citations = community standing. Google weighs all this evidence and decides who ranks first.
