              Met this electrician at a supply house on Cherry Ave. He goes "I'm the best sparky in Long Beach but I'm getting beat by guys who dont know code from a hole in the wall." Truth is, them other guys know Google code, and that's what matters online.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              People dont call electricians for fun. Power goes out, outlet sparking, need a Tesla charger installed - they searching RIGHT NOW. If you aint showing up for "electrician near me" or "emergency electrician Long Beach," you losing money every single day.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Saw one electrical contractor in California Heights go from doing residential service calls to wiring whole apartment buildings. How? We got him ranking for "commercial electrician Long Beach" and suddenly property managers was calling. One good SEO keyword changed his whole business.

            <p>
              Its like having your truck parked on every corner in Long Beach, but digital. When someone types "panel upgrade Belmont Shore" or "EV charger installation Naples," your business pops up first.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              But electrician SEO got its own tricks. You dealing with emergency searches AND planned projects. Someone searching "electrician near me" at midnight different than someone searching "kitchen remodel electrical" on Sunday morning. You need both.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think bout it like your electrical panel. Every circuit gotta be connected right or nothing works. Same with SEO - your Google Business Profile, website, reviews, local citations - all gotta flow together or you getting no juice from Google.

              This house flipper in Rose Park called me panicking. City inspector red-tagged his whole flip cuz the electrical was a mess. Previous "electrician" wasnt licensed, did everything wrong. Now he needed someone fast to fix it all and pass inspection.

              He found my client searching "code correction electrician Long Beach." Not just "electrician" but specific to his problem. We had pages for every electrical issue - code violations, failed inspections, permit problems. That one ranking saved his flip and got my client a $30k rewire job.

                Electricians used to get work from contractor referrals. That still works but its slow. As a marketing agency, we get you direct customers. Google Ads for emergency calls, Facebook for residential work, LinkedIn for commercial projects. But SEO is foundation cuz once you rank, them calls keep coming without paying per click.

                Had an electrician say "I know watts and volts, not websites and Google." I get it. As a marketing consultant, I translate. Why your Google reviews matter more than BBB rating. Why before/after photos of panel upgrades get clicks. Why you need separate pages for residential and commercial. Plain English, no marketing BS.

            <p>
              People scared of electricians more than other trades. Electricity kills. Bad wiring burns houses. So they read every review careful. One electrician in Lakewood had just 15 reviews but all mentioned "licensed," "safe," "to code." Started outranking guys with 100+ reviews.
            </p>

              <p>
                After big jobs, ask customers to mention specific things in reviews - "passed inspection first time," "fixed what other electrician messed up," "explained everything." These keywords help SEO and build trust. Way better than generic "great service" reviews.

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>
              Lot of great electricians think their C-10 license enough. "I'm licensed, insured, been doing this 20 years." Cool, but the unlicensed hack with good SEO getting more calls than you. Fair? No. Reality? Yes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Also, electricians always fighting on price but thats cuz they all look the same online. Good SEO lets you show WHY you cost more. Master electrician, not journeyman. Pull permits, not bootleg. Fix it right first time, not come back three times. But if Google dont know this, customers dont know this.
