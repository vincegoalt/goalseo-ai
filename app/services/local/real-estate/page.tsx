            <p>
              This agent in Naples told me she spending $3,000 a month on Zillow Premier Agent. Three grand! Every month! And half them leads was trash - people just browsing, not serious. Meanwhile, agent down the street getting organic Google leads for free. Quality leads too - people actually ready to buy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Real estate different now. Buyers start online way before they call an agent. They searching "homes for sale Belmont Shore" or "condos Downtown Long Beach" at midnight. If your website dont show up, they calling whoever does.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Helped this new agent in Bixby Knolls. Zero listings, competing against teams been there 20 years. Got her ranking for "first time home buyer Long Beach" and "FHA loans Bixby Knolls." Six months later she had 8 transactions. All from being findable for what she specialized in.
            </p>

              <p>
                Agent in Alamitos Heights was losing listing presentations. We got him ranking #1 for "sell my home Alamitos Heights." Now when sellers Google him before meeting, they see him dominating search. He went from 30% conversion on listing appointments to 70%. SEO builds trust before you even meet.

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>
              Its being the answer when someone types "real estate agent near me" or "homes for sale [neighborhood]." Not just on Google, but YouTube for property tours, Instagram for lifestyle content, everything.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Real estate SEO gotta cover both sides - buyers AND sellers. "Homes for sale" different than "sell my house fast." First-time buyers different than investors. Beach properties different than inland. You need strategy for each.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think of it like MLS listings. You dont just say "house for sale" - you got details, photos, descriptions. Same with SEO. Every neighborhood, every property type, every price range needs its own approach.
