            <p>
              CPA buddy near Downtown told me something crazy. March and April, he turning away clients. Rest of the year? Cricket sounds. Problem was everybody finding him during tax season but nobody knew he did bookkeeping, payroll, business consulting year-round.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              See, people think CPAs just for taxes. But you doing CFO services, estate planning, business valuations, all kinds of stuff. If you only ranking for "tax preparation Long Beach," you missing 75% of potential revenue. Smart CPAs rank for everything they do.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Helped this young CPA in Bixby Knolls. Fresh outta USC, no clients. We got her ranking for "small business accountant Long Beach" and "QuickBooks ProAdvisor near me." Now she got 30 monthly clients paying recurring fees. Steady income beats tax season rush.
            </p>

              <p>
                CPA in Signal Hill started ranking for "cannabis business CPA Long Beach." These dispensaries need specialized accounting - 280E tax issues, cash management, compliance. He charging premium rates, only takes 5 cannabis clients, making more than his whole traditional practice. Niche SEO = big money.

            <p>
              Its making sure when someone gets IRS letter, needs bookkeeper, or starting business, YOUR accounting firm pops up first. Not H&R Block. Not TurboTax ads. You - the local expert who actually understands California taxes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              CPA SEO gotta cover both emergency ("IRS audit help") and planning ("estate tax planning Long Beach"). Business owners search different than individuals. "Business tax accountant" vs "personal tax preparer." Each needs own approach.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think bout it like tax forms. You dont use same form for everyone - W2s, 1099s, Schedule C, all different. Same with SEO. Every service, every client type needs specific strategy to rank.
