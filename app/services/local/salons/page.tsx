          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>
              Hair salon owner on 2nd Street was bout to close. Instagram pretty but wasn't bringing clients. Yelp reviews good but expensive ads. Then we got her ranking for "balayage Belmont Shore" and "blonde specialist Long Beach." Now she booked 3 weeks out, raised prices twice.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Thing is, beauty is emergency business sometimes. "Hair salon open now," "last minute nails," "wedding hair tomorrow." If you aint showing up for these panic searches, you missing easy money. Plus regular searches like "Brazilian blowout near me" that bring high-ticket clients.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Helped this nail salon in Cambodia Town. They amazing at nail art but nobody knew they existed. Got them ranking for "Japanese nail art Long Beach" and "gel extensions." Went from empty chairs to hiring 3 more techs. All from being findable for what they specialize in.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-rose-50 border-l-4 border-rose-500 p-6 my-8">
              <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">The Instagram + SEO Power Move:</p>
              <p>
                Salon in Naples was killing it on Instagram but not getting clients. We synced their IG with SEO - every popular hairstyle post became a page on website. "Lived-in blonde Long Beach," "Beach waves Naples." Now Instagram followers can actually FIND them on Google. Double win.

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>
              Its making sure when someone needs their roots done, wants new nails, or searching for wedding hair, YOUR salon shows up first. Not SuperCuts. Not some chain. Your salon where they gonna get personalized service.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Salon SEO gotta cover services AND styles. "Haircut" too general. But "curtain bangs Long Beach" or "mens fade Belmont Shore" - thats money. People search for specific looks they saw on TikTok or Pinterest.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think of Google like a beauty magazine. You showing Google you got the skills, portfolio, reviews to deliver what clients want. Every before/after photo, every 5-star review, every service page builds your case.
